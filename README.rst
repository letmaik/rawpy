rawpy is an easy-to-use Python wrapper for the LibRaw_ library.
It also contains some extra functionality for finding and repairing hot/dead pixels.

Sample code
-----------

Load a RAW file and save the postprocessed image using default parameters:

.. code-block:: python

	import rawpy
	import imageio
	
	path = 'image.nef'
	with rawpy.imread(path) as raw:
	    rgb = raw.postprocess()
	imageio.imsave('default.tiff', rgb)
	
Save as 16-bit linear image:

.. code-block:: python
	
	with rawpy.imread(path) as raw:
	    rgb = raw.postprocess(gamma=(1,1), no_auto_bright=True, output_bps=16)
	imageio.imsave('linear.tiff', rgb)

Find bad pixels using multiple RAW files and repair them:

.. code-block:: python

	import rawpy.enhance
	
	paths = ['image1.nef', 'image2.nef', 'image3.nef']
	bad_pixels = rawpy.enhance.find_bad_pixels(paths)
	
	for path in paths:
	    with rawpy.imread(path) as raw:
	        rawpy.enhance.repair_bad_pixels(raw, bad_pixels, method='median')
	        rgb = raw.postprocess()
	    imageio.imsave(path + '.tiff', rgb)

Installation
------------

Binary wheels for Linux, macOS, and Windows are provided for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.
These can be installed with a simple ``pip install rawpy``.
Currently, Linux and macOS wheels are only available as 64 bit versions.

The underlying LibRaw_ library supports several optional features.
The following table shows which PyPI binary wheels support which features.

================== ======= ===== =====
Feature            Windows macOS Linux
------------------ ------- ----- -----
LCMS color engine  no      yes   yes
RedCine codec      no      yes   yes
DNG deflate codec  yes     yes   yes
DNG lossy codec    yes     yes   yes
Demosaic Pack GPL2 no      no    no
Demosaic Pack GPL3 no      no    no
OpenMP             yes     no    yes
================== ======= ===== =====

Tip: You can dynamically query supported features by inspecting the `rawpy.flags` dictionary.

Note on Windows features: The LCMS color engine and RedCine codec features are currently not
supported as the `automated build process <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/letmaik/rawpy>`_
to generate wheels relies on Anaconda to supply any needed library dependencies.
For RedCine codec support, the Windows variant of the `Jasper library <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jasper>`_ is missing,
and for LCMS color engine support, the `LCMS library <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/lcms>`_ is missing.

Note on GPL demosaic packs: The GPL2 and GPL3 demosaic packs are not included as rawpy is licensed
under the MIT license which is incompatible with GPL.

Installation from source on Linux/macOS
---------------------------------------

If you have the need to use a specific libraw version or you can't use the provided binary wheels
then follow the steps in this section to build rawpy from source.

First, install the LibRaw_ library on your system.

On Ubuntu, you can get (an outdated) version with:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install libraw-dev
    
Or install the latest release version from the source repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw.git libraw
    git clone https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw-cmake.git libraw-cmake
    cd libraw
    git checkout 0.19.2
    cp -R ../libraw-cmake/* .
    cmake .
    sudo make install
    
After that, install rawpy using ``pip install rawpy --no-binary rawpy``.
    
If you get the error "ImportError: libraw.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
when trying to use rawpy, then do the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    echo "/usr/local/lib" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/99local.conf
    sudo ldconfig

The LibRaw library is installed in /usr/local/lib (if installed manually) and apparently this folder is not searched
for libraries by default in some Linux distributions.

NumPy Dependency
----------------

rawpy depends on NumPy. The minimum supported NumPy version depends on your Python version:

========== =========
Python     NumPy
---------- ---------
2.7        >= 1.9
3.5        >= 1.9
3.6        >= 1.11
3.7        >= 1.14
